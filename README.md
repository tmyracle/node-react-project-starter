# Node/React Project Starter

Bootstrap a web app project:

- Express / NodeJS backend
- Postgres
- React
- Ant Design Component Kit for UI
- Tailwind CSS for styles

By default the client runs on localhost:3000 and the API runs on localhost:5000
Database is run using a docker image.  
API is not containerized at this point.

**TODO**

- Build base landing page
- Have separate sign up and log in pages (set up flow?)
- Add ability to send transactional emails
- Add chron job to automatically clear auth code after 2 mins
